- 👋 Hi, I’m @Igigog
- 👀 I’m interested in code architecture, machine learning, modding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Well, everything? I'm getting my bachelor degree at CS. I am also working on Java Spring web platform, trying to run some demoscene on FPGA, learning neural networks and trying not to die from overworking. Still alive. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Igi Tasks (Stalker Anomaly mod).
- 📫 How to reach me:
