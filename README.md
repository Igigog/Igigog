- 👋 Hi, I’m @Igigog
- 👀 I’m interested in code architecture, machine learning, modding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Well, everything? I'm getting my bachelor degree at CS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Igi Tasks (Stalker Anomaly mod). Also I'm getting a break from it now, so if you have any suggestions you are welcome.
